# Managing Labs and Organizations

Organizations are the top-level container in APGAP. Each institution — ASU, ADHS, University of Arizona, NAU, TGen, or a partner agency — should be an Organization. Labs belong to Organizations.

Creating a lab triggers a Cloud Build pipeline that provisions a dedicated Google Cloud project for the lab — including a GCS bucket, IAM configuration, and VPC. **This process takes 5 to 15 minutes**.

Every lab must have at least one Lab Director before users can be assigned or files can be uploaded. It is recommended to assign a second Lab Director to a lab as backup in cases when the first Lab Director is unavailable.
