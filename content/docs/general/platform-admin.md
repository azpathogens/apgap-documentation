# Platform Admin access and constraints
Platform Admin status is controlled by the is_platform_admin boolean flag on a user's account. When this flag is set, the user is automatically added to the Platform Admin Django permission group, which governs all API-level access checks.

**Important constraints for Platform Admin accounts:**

- Platform Admins **cannot be added to individual Labs or Projects**. The system enforces this — if a user needs both admin access and lab membership...
- Changes to the is_platform_admin flag take effect immediately. The user does not need to log out and back in.

To set or remove Platform Admin status for a user, navigate to **Administration** → **User** **Management**, find the user, click the edit icon, and toggle the **Platform Admin** switch.
