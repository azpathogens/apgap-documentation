# Download a metadata CSV template
Metadata tells APGAP what each sequence file represents — the organism, collection date, location, and other scientific details. APGAP uses Source Types (Human, Wastewater, Wildlife, Animal/Livestock, etc.) to determine which fields are required.

The CSV will download to your browser's default download folder. It's strongly recommended to rename the file before filling it in so you can track which batch it belongs to.

Understanding the CSV template:
- **Row 1** — Column headers (field names). Do not modify these.
- **Row 2** — Shows REQUIRED or OPTIONAL for each field. Do not modify this row.
- **Rows 3 onwards** — Add one row per file

The first column is always filename. This must contain the exact filename as it appears in APGAP, including the file extension and matching case.

**Note**: If your Platform Admin has added custom metadata fields via Metadata Management, those fields will appear in the template automatically.
