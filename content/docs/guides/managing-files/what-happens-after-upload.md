# What happens after you upload a file

When you upload a sequence file, it doesn't appear in your lab immediately. APGAP runs it through a short processing pipeline first, which is why a new file shows **PROCESSING** for several minutes before it becomes usable. This page explains what that pipeline does and what to do when a file doesn't come out the other side cleanly.

### The processing pipeline

1. **Registration.** The file first goes into temporary storage for processing, is recorded in your lab and marked **PROCESSING**.
1. **PII scan.** Google Cloud DLP scans the file for personal information. If it finds any, the file is set to **PII_DETECTED** and held. The file does not leave temporary storage and will be promptly destroyed.
1. **Human read scrubbing.** For FASTQ files, APGAP runs the SRA human read scrubber, which removes (masks) human sequence reads before the file is stored. This step loads a large reference database, so it takes longer for FASTQ files than for other file types. Non-FASTQ files skip this step.
1. At the end of processing, after the previous steps are completed, the file with masked human reads (if any were detected) moves into the persistent storage for your Lab's sequences, associated with the record from the first step, and status is updated to **DRAFT**.  The file is now ready for metadata to be associated with it (see [Promote to Primary](../promote-file-to-primary)).

Processing usually takes 5–15 minutes depending on file size. Larger FASTQ files take longer because of the scrubbing step. The status updates on its own; refresh the **Sequences** tab to see the current state.

### When a file doesn't process cleanly

| Status | What it means | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PII_DETECTED** | The file was flagged as possibly containing personal information | Do not attempt to re-upload it as-is. Contact your Lab Director, who can review the flag and decide how to proceed |
| **FAILED** | A step in the pipeline did not complete in time, or errored | Delete the file and upload it again. If it fails a second time, contact your Lab Director with the filename |
| **Stuck in PROCESSING** for much longer than expected | A very large file may still be scrubbing legitimately | Give it more time. APGAP automatically moves a file to **FAILED** once it passes its expected processing window, and notifies you — so a genuinely stuck file will not sit in PROCESSING forever |

A file only reaches **DRAFT** after it has cleared the PII scan and (for FASTQ) the scrubber. A file you can see and edit has already been through those checks.
